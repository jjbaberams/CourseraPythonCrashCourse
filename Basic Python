# Hello all - I'm uploading snippets of code I think might be useful for other semi-beginners, or people who are feeling rusty. If you see a mistake, tell me pls!

# Sample prompt:

# REPLACE THIS STARTER CODE WITH YOUR FUNCTION
june_days = 30
print("June has" + str(june_days) + " days.")
july_days = 31
print("July has " + str(july_days) + " days.")


# (ANSWER): 
def month_days(month,days):
    print(month + " has " + str(days) + " days.")
month_days("June", "30")
month_days("July", "31")




#Sample prompt:

# REFACTOR THIS CODE: 
def f1(x, y):
    z = x*y  # the area is base*height
    print("The area is " + str(z))
    
    
# ANSWER:
def rectangle_area(base, height):
    area = base * height  # the area is base*height
    print("The area is " + str(area))
# Below, (5,6) are the figures used in the prompt
rectangle_area(5,6)





# Quiz Question/Answer filled in:
# 1) Complete the function to return the result of the conversion
def convert_distance(miles):
	km = miles * 1.6  # approximately 1.6 km in 1 mile

my_trip_miles = 55

# 2) Convert my_trip_miles to kilometers by calling the function above
my_trip_km = my_trip_miles * 1.6 

# 3) Fill in the blank to print the result of the conversion
print("The distance in kilometers is " + str(my_trip_km))

# 4) Calculate the round-trip in kilometers by doubling the result,
#    and fill in the blank to print the result
print("The round-trip in kilometers is " + str(my_trip_km * 2))





# Let's revisit our lucky_number function. We want to change it, so that instead of printing the message, it returns the message. This way, 
# the calling line can print the message, or do something else with it if needed. Fill in the blanks to complete the code to make it work.

def lucky_number(name):
  number = len(name) * 9
  message = "Hello " + name + ". Your lucky number is " + str(number)
  return message
	    
print(lucky_number("Kay"))
print(lucky_number("Cameron"))






# Writing a program that will tell the user whether their username is valid or not
def hint_username(username):
  if len(username) < 3:
    print("Invalid username. Must be at least 3 characters long")
# The body of the IF block will only execute when the condition evaluates to TRUE; otherwise it's skipped
# Then add "Valid Username
  else:
    print("Valid username")




# Sample The is_positive function should return True if the number received is positive, otherwise it returns None. 
# Can you fill in the gaps to make that happen? (then make it say false if 0 or negative!)
def is_positive(number):
  if number > 0:
    return True
  else:
    return False
    
    
# Is the value even or odd?
def is_even(number)
  if number % 2 == 0
    return True
  return False
    
    
    
    
    
# MY FIRST ATTEMPT TO WRITE SOMETHING ORIGINAL!
def lucky_number(name):
  number = len(name) * 9
  message = "Hello " + name + ". Your lucky number is " + str(number)
  fortune = "Congratulations " + name + ". You have won a cosmic prize! Your lucky number is " + str(number)
  if number % 2 == 0:
    return message
  else:
    return fortune

print(lucky_number("Jimmy"))
print(lucky_number("Cassandra"))
print(lucky_number("JJ"))
print(lucky_number("Doug"))

# AND IT WORKS!!!!!
